CatScan is a program for performing categorization experiments with icons, and collecting the results of these experiments.

Dr. Alexander Klippel (klippel@psu.edu) is the overall project manager. Programming was done by Stefan Hansen, Jan Oliver Wallgrün and Frank Hardisty. Jan Oliver Wallgrün is the current maintainer.

We thank the Faculty of Engineering, University of Melbourne, and the National Science Foundation (through the "Contextual influences on the category construction of geographic-scale movement patterns" grant) for their support.
