# Introduction #

CatScan is a program that allows the user to run experiments on how icons are categorized. These directions are intended to be complete and accurate. Suggestions and corrections are very welcome, please contact Frank Hardisty (hardisty@psu.edu, lead developer) and/or Alex Klippel (klippel@psu.edu, project manager).

The following instructions have been tested using the Windows 7 operating system.

Step 1. Verify that you have a recent version of Java correctly installed. Open a command line window. One way to do this is to type "cmd" into the Windows start search box, as seen here ![http://catscan.googlecode.com/files/command_window.png](http://catscan.googlecode.com/files/command_window.png). Type in "java -version" in the command window. If you see something like:

java version "1.6.0\_21"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_21-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0-b17, mixed mode)

then you are set. Otherwise, go to this page and follow the download and install instructions: http://www.java.com/en/download/.

Step 2. Download CatScan. The most recent binary (runnable) version is here: http://code.google.com/p/catscan/downloads/detail?name=CatScan-static-hurricanes-11-09-April-2010.zip.

Step 3. Unzip the file to a local directory. 7-Zip works well for this purpose, the native Windows zip file extractor should work as well.

Step 4. (Complete this step only if new icons are desired) Delete the icons from the "events" directory, and place the new icons into the "events" directory. Leave the "trail" directory alone.

Step 5. Click on the "Run CatScan.bat" file to start CatScan. If you see a warning dialog, click "Run" to continue.

Step 6. Click on the "START" button when you are ready to administer the experiment.

After running the experiment, you may wish to use the ResultsCollector
